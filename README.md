# 1D_Ising_Model_Simulation

This work was produced as a bachelor thesis project for the course of Physics at the University of Milano-Bicocca. It covers the simulation of a one-dimensional Ising chain of 4 qubits with transverse field and is based on the work of Alba-Cervera Lierta and Marc Ferras called "Simulation of the 1d XY model on a quantum computer" and published on SciPost Phys. All of the articles used for this thesis can be found in the references.

NOTE: In the sourcecode, the connection to IBM's quantum computers may not work anymore since the company updated the functions to do it.
